question: There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer n, indicating that you must do the following routine for n minutes:

At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.
Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.

code"

class Solution {
public:
    long long coloredCells(int n) {
        // Calculate the total number of colored cells in an n x n grid.
        
        // The formula used is:
        // 1 (for the center cell) + 4 * (number of edges) * (number of edges - 1) / 2
        // This accounts for the cells colored along the edges of the grid.
        
        // The 4LL ensures that the multiplication is done using long long to avoid overflow.
        return 1 + 4LL * n * (n - 1) / 2; 
    }
};
