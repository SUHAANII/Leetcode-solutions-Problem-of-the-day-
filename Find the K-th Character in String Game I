question: Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

You are given a positive integer k.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:

Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.
For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".

Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters.

Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.



code;

 static char kthCharacter(int k) {
        // Base case: if k is 1, return 'a'
        if (k == 1) return 'a';

        int shift = 0;

        // Calculate the bit ceiling to find the range of k
        for (int b = bit_ceil((unsigned)k); b > 1; b >>= 1) {
            // If k is in the second half of the current range
            if (k > b / 2) {
                k -= b / 2; // Adjust k to reflect its position in the first half
                shift++; // Increment the shift counter
            }
        }

        // Return the character shifted by how many times it moved into the second half
        return 'a' + (shift % 26);
    }

private:
    // Function to calculate the next power of 2 greater than or equal to k
    static int bit_ceil(unsigned k) {
        if (k == 0) return 1; // If k is 0, the next power of 2 is 1
        int power = 1;
        while (power < k) {
            power <<= 1; // Double the power of 2
        }
        return power;
