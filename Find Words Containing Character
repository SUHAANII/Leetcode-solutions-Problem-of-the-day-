question: You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.

Note that the returned array may be in any order.


code:
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find indices of words containing the character 'x'
    vector<int> findWordsContaining(vector<string>& words, char x) {
        // Vector to store the result indices
        vector<int> res;

        // Loop through each word in the vector 'words'
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            // Loop through each character in the current word
            for (int j = 0; j < words[i].size(); j++) {
                // Check if the current character matches 'x'
                if (words[i][j] == x) {
                    // If found, add the index of the word to the result vector
                    res.push_back(i);
                    // Break out of the inner loop to avoid duplicate entries for the same word
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Return the vector containing indices of words that contain the character 'x'
        return res;
    }
};
