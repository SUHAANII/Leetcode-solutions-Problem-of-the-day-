question: Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x such that n == 4x.



code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        // Check if the number is less than or equal to zero
        // Since powers of four are positive numbers, return false for non-positive numbers
        if (n <= 0) return false;

        // Calculate the exponent by counting leading zeros in the binary representation of n
        // exp = 31 - countl_zero((unsigned)n) gives the position of the highest set bit
        int exp = 31 - __builtin_clz((unsigned)n); // log2(n)

        // Check if the exponent is even (which means n is a power of 4)
        // Also check if n is exactly equal to 2 raised to the power of exp
        return (exp & 1) == 0 && n == (1 << exp);
    }
};
