Question: You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.

code:
// Initialize indices for the positions of differences and a counter for mismatches
int i = -1, j = -1;
int cnt = 0;

// Loop through each character of the strings s1 and s2
for (int k = 0; k < s1.length(); k++) {
    // Check if characters at the current position are different
    if (s1[k] != s2[k]) {
        cnt++; // Increment the mismatch counter
        
        // If this is the first mismatch, record its index
        if (i == -1) {
            i = k; // Set i to the current index
        } 
        // If this is the second mismatch, record its index
        else if (j == -1) {
            j = k; // Set j to the current index
        }
    }
}

// Check if there were no mismatches
if (cnt == 0) {
    return true; // Strings are identical, return true
} 
// Check if there were exactly two mismatches and they can be swapped to make the strings equal
else if (cnt == 2 && s1[i] == s2[j] && s1[j] == s2[i]) {
    return true; // The two mismatched characters can be swapped, return true
}

// If none of the above conditions are met, return false
return false; // Strings cannot be made equal by a single swap
