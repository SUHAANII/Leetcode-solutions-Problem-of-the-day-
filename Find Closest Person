question: You are given three integers x, y, and z, representing the positions of three people on a number line:

x is the position of Person 1.
y is the position of Person 2.
z is the position of Person 3, who does not move.
Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.

Determine which person reaches Person 3 first:

Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first.
Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first.
Return 0 if both arrive at the same time.
Return the result accordingly.

code:
class Solution {
public:
    int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {
        // Calculate the absolute differences between z and x, and z and y
        // abs(x - z) gives the distance from x to z
        // abs(y - z) gives the distance from y to z

        // Check if the distance from x to z is equal to the distance from y to z
        if (abs(x - z) == abs(y - z)) {
            return 0;  // If both distances are equal, return 0
        }
        
        // If the distance from x to z is less than the distance from y to z,
        // return 1 (indicating x is closer to z)
        // Otherwise, return 2 (indicating y is closer to z)
        return 2 - (abs(x - z) < abs(y - z));
    }
};
