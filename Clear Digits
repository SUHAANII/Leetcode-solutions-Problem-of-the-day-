Question: You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.
Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

 

code:
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to clear digits from the string
    static string clearDigits(string& s) {
        int n = s.size(); // Get the size of the string
        int j = 0; // Initialize a pointer j to track the position to write non-digit characters
        
        // Iterate through each character in the string
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check if the current character is a digit
            if (isdigit(s[i]) && j > 0) {
                // If it's a digit and j is greater than 0, decrement j to "remove" the last non-digit character
                j--;
            } else {
                // If it's not a digit, write the character at position j and increment j
                s[j++] = s[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Resize the string to the new length, effectively removing the unwanted characters
        s.resize(j);
        
        // Return the modified string
        return s;
    }
};
