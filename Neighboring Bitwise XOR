Question: A 0-indexed array derived with length n is derived by computing the bitwise XOR (⊕) of adjacent values in a binary array original of length n.

Specifically, for each index i in the range [0, n - 1]:

If i = n - 1, then derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[0].
Otherwise, derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[i + 1].
Given an array derived, your task is to determine whether there exists a valid binary array original that could have formed derived.

Return true if such an array exists or false otherwise.

A binary array is an array containing only 0's and 1's

code: 

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to determine if a valid array exists based on the derived array
    static bool doesValidArrayExist(vector<int>& derived) {
        // Use reduce to calculate the sum of the elements in the derived array
        // The reduce function starts from an initial value of 0 and sums up all elements
        // The result is then checked to see if it is even or odd
        // The expression (sum & 1) checks if the sum is odd (result will be 1) or even (result will be 0)
        // If the result is 0 (even), return true; otherwise, return false
        return (reduce(derived.begin(), derived.end(), 0) & 1) == 0;
    }
};
