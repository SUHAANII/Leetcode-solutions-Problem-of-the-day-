Question: Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that is a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string

code: 

//<---------------------Method 1------------------->//
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find all strings that are substrings of other strings
    vector<string> stringMatching(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size(); // Get the number of words in the input vector
        vector<string> ans; // Vector to store the result strings

        // Outer loop to iterate through each word in the vector
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Inner loop to compare the current word with every other word
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                // Check if the indices are different and if words[j] contains words[i]
                if (i != j && words[j].find(words[i]) != string::npos) {
                    ans.push_back(words[i]); // Add the substring to the result
                    break; // Exit the inner loop once a match is found
                }
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the vector of substring matches
    }
};
