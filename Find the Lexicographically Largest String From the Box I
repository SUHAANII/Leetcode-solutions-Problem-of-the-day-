question: You are given a string word, and an integer numFriends.

Alice is organizing a game for her numFriends friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

word is split into numFriends non-empty strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
All the split words are put into a box.
Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

code:


class Solution {
public:
    // Function to generate the answer string based on the input word and number of friends
    string answerString(string word, int numFriends) {
        // If there is only one friend, return the original word
        if (numFriends == 1) return word;

        // Initialize an empty string to store the result
        string res = "";

        // Iterate through each character in the word
        for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
            // Extract a substring starting from the current index 'i'
            // and having a length that allows for 'numFriends' characters to be excluded
            res = max(res, word.substr(i, word.length() - numFriends + 1));
        }

        // Return the maximum substring found
        return res;
    }
};
