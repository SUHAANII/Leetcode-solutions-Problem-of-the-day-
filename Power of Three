question: Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

code;

// C++
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if a number is a power of three
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        // If n is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be a power of three
        if (n <= 0) return false;

        // Continuously divide n by 3 as long as it is divisible by 3
        while (n % 3 == 0) {
            n /= 3; // Divide n by 3
        }

        // If n becomes 1, then it is a power of three; otherwise, it's not
        return n == 1;
    }
};
