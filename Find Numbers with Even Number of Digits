question: given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.
code:

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to count how many numbers in the vector have an even number of digits.
    int findNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Initialize a counter to keep track of numbers with an even number of digits.
        int count = 0;

        // Iterate through each number in the vector.
        for (int i : nums) {
            // Convert the current number to a string to check its length.
            string s = to_string(i);

            // Check if the length of the string representation is even.
            if (s.size() % 2 == 0) {
                // If even, increment the count.
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Return the total count of numbers with an even number of digits.
        return count;
    }
};
