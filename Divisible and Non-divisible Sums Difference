question: You are given positive integers n and m.

Define two integers as follows:

num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m.
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.
Return the integer num1 - num2.

code:

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the difference of sums
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        // Initialize two variables to hold the sums
        int num1 = 0; // Sum of numbers not divisible by m
        int num2 = 0; // Sum of numbers divisible by m
        
        // Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Check if the current number i is divisible by m
            if (i % m == 0) {
                // If it is divisible, add it to num2
                num2 += i;
            } else {
                // If it is not divisible, add it to num1
                num1 += i;
            }
        }
        
        // Return the difference between the two sums
        return num1 - num2;
    }
};
