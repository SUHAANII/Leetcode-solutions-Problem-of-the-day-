Question: Given a string s and an integer k, return true if you can use all the characters in s to construct k palindrome strings or false otherwise.

code:
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to determine if we can construct k palindromes from string s
    bool canConstruct(string s, int k) {
        // If the length of the string is less than k, it's impossible to create k palindromes
        if (s.length() < k) return false;

        // Sort the string to group identical characters together
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        
        // Variable to count the number of characters with odd occurrences
        int oddCount = 0;

        // Iterate through the sorted string
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ) {
            // Store the current character
            char current = s[i];
            // Count the occurrences of the current character
            int count = 0;

            // Count how many times the current character appears consecutively
            while (i < s.length() && s[i] == current) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }

            // If the count of the current character is odd, increment the oddCount
            if (count % 2 != 0) oddCount++;
        }

        // To form k palindromes, we can have at most k characters with odd occurrences
        return oddCount <= k;
    }
};
