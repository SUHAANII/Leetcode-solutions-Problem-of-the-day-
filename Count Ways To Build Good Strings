Question:  Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

code:

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to count the number of good strings within a specified length range.
    int countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;  // Define a constant for modulo operation to prevent overflow.
        
        // Create a vector to store the number of ways to create strings of each length up to 'high'.
        vector<int> ways(high + 1, 0);
        ways[0] = 1;  // There's one way to create a string of length 0 (the empty string).

        // Iterate through all possible lengths from 0 to 'high'.
        for (int length = 0; length <= high; ++length) {
            // If there are no ways to form a string of this length, skip to the next length.
            if (ways[length] == 0) continue;

            // If adding 'zero' to the current length does not exceed 'high', update the ways.
            if (length + zero <= high) {
                ways[length + zero] = (ways[length + zero] + ways[length]) % MOD;
            }

            // If adding 'one' to the current length does not exceed 'high', update the ways.
            if (length + one <= high) {
                ways[length + one] = (ways[length + one] + ways[length]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        // Initialize a counter to sum the number of good strings within the specified range.
        int count = 0;
        // Iterate from 'low' to 'high' to accumulate the total number of good strings.
        for (int i = low; i <= high; ++i) {
            count = (count + ways[i]) % MOD;  // Add the number of ways for each valid length.
        }

        return count;  // Return the total count of good strings.
    }
};
