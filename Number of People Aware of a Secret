question: On day 1, one person discovers a secret.

You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day, starting from delay days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.

Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

code:

class Solution {
public:
    int peopleAwareOfSecret(int n, int delay, int forget) {
        // Create a vector to store the number of people who learn the secret on each day
        vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);
        
        // On the first day, one person knows the secret
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        long long share = 0; // This variable will track the total number of people who can share the secret
        long long MOD = 1000000007; // A constant to perform modulo operations to prevent overflow
        
        // Iterate over each day from 2 to n
        for (int t = 2; t <= n; t++) {
            // If the current day is after the delay period, people can start sharing the secret
            if (t - delay > 0)
                // Add the number of people who can share the secret today
                share = (share + dp[t - delay] + MOD) % MOD;
            
            // If the current day is after the forget period, those who learned the secret will forget it
            if (t - forget > 0)
                // Subtract the number of people who forget the secret today
                share = (share - dp[t - forget] + MOD) % MOD;
            
            // The number of new people who learn the secret today is equal to the number of people who can share it
            dp[t] = share;
        }
        
        long long know = 0; // This variable will store the total number of people who know the secret at the end
        
        // Sum the number of people who learned the secret in the last 'forget' days
        for (int i = n - forget + 1; i <= n; i++)
            know = (know + dp[i]) % MOD;
        
        // Return the total number of people who know the secret, converting it to an integer
        return (int)know;
    }
};
