question: You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

code:

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to convert the number with maximum possible value by changing one '6' to '9'
    int maximum69Number(int num) {
        // Convert the integer num to a string for easy manipulation
        std::string s = std::to_string(num);
        
        // Iterate through each character in the string representation
        for (char &c : s) {
            // Check if the current character is '6'
            if (c == '6') { 
                c = '9'; // Change the first '6' found to '9'
                break; // Exit the loop after making the change
            }
        }
        
        // Convert the modified string back to an integer and return it
        return std::stoi(s);
    }
};
